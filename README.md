### Hi there 👋

# About me
### Certified school drop out.
I dropped out of school when I was 15. The current scholar system was not something that I could spend any more time in. I got a job at a local company which suited me perfectly and gives me a lot of possibilities to expand my knowledge and keep learning.

### Working to make the internet a better and more secure place one step at a time.
I believe web applications are the future and will replace our desktop programs and mobile apps, that’s why they should be usable by everyone and everywhere no matter the device, screen size and speed. While they provide these pros, they should also be secure and privacy oriented.
